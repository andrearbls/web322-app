          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>Hi there, my name is Andrea Robles, and I am currently enrolled in Computer Programming and Analysis at
            Seneca College, Newnham campus. I am in my third semester and so far I am really enjoying being in this
            program. I also graduated and have a diploma in Dental Hygiene from Oxford College of Business, Arts, and
            Technology. I am currently working part-time at a dental office as an office administrator/patient
            coordinator while studying full-time at the same time. Ever since I was in high school, I have always been
            interested in studying computers, however, most of my family members are in the dental career field that is
            why I got pressured to take a career that would fit in. During the time that I was working in the dental
            office, I realized that this career is not for me, so I took the big decision of changing my career by
            applying at Seneca College in order to get into the Computer Programming and Analysis program. I believe
            that if given a chance at obtaining something that will make us happy, it is worth the risk. Life is too
            short to live with regrets, and at this point, I can confidently say that I am happy with the decision I
            made in pursuing the Computer Programming and Analysis program.</p>
          <p>During my free time, I do a lot of outdoor and indoor activities with my family and friends. For instance,
            when it is summertime I go hiking, fishing, and camping in different areas here in Ontario that I have not
            been to. I also like doing yoga and pilates in order to stay fit physically and mentally. In addition, I
            also want to share my favourite hobby during summer which is doing obstacle courses at Treetop Trekking. On
            the other hand, when it is wintertime I usually go skating and go to escape games in order to practice and
            enhance my problem-solving skills. Moreover, I also like going to the movie theatre to catch my favourite
            movie on the big screen.</p>
          <p>My current goal in life is to successfully pass all my courses in my program while maintaining an excellent
            GPA record. After I graduate, I am aiming in getting into a reputable company where my training, knowledge,
            and skills will be an attribute and asset to the continual growth and development of my employer, as well as
            my co-workers. Once I establish myself, I want to become an inspiration to others and spread awareness that
            success has no timeline. If you believe in yourself, you will always do great things and find a way to
            achieve all your goals in life.</p>
